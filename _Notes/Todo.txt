Todo List
* Fork orignal doom source code and port to MetalOS
  * Use CPP for port entry points
* Convert MetalOS header to c++
* extract x64 functionality out to library
* Kernel DPCs
* Windowing system
* UserThread shouldn't use a full context structure
* Remove .init and just inject a dll with entries
* Move loader entirely userside?
